# Array Insert Shift
+ The challenge is to implement a function called InsertShiftArray in C# that takes an array as input and a value and returns a new array with the value added in the middle index.

#
## -Approach & Efficiency
+ The approach I took for the InsertShiftArray function is as follows:    
1.Create insertShiftArray function that takes int array and a value to add at the middle.         
2.Initialize middleIndex value that store the middle index of the array.         
3.Create for loop to copy the elements before the middle index to the new array.           
4.Insert the value at the middle index of the new array.             
5.copy the rest of the elements after the middle index to the new array.            
6.Return the new array.
